# responsive-portfolio
This responsive portfolio uses Bootstrap styling to create a responsive website. The website contains an About section, a Portfolio, and a Contact page. 
The About page uses a Riker Ipsum generated text from http://www.rikeripsum.com and a floating image from pixabay.com. The card the ipsum and photo are housed in is set at a column setting of 10 to create a margin at a lg and md viewport size. The card is set to a 12 column for the sm and xs viewport settings. 
The Portfolio page has 5 cards with images inside them. The cards are set to a 6 column setting for viewport sizes lg and md, and 12 for sm and xs - this wraps the cards when scaling the browser or viewing on a mobile device. The cards contain images from pixabay and link to various website of interest: https://magnolia.com/, https://www.towerhillbg.org/visit/, https://www.mauidiveshop.com/, https://www.foodnetwork.com/, and https://www.metmuseum.org/. The 5 cards are in a div that has padding to make it look like they are inside a larger card. 
The Contact page is similar to the About page: it is set at for 10 columns at lg and md viewports to create a margin and set to a 12 column for the sm and xs viewport settings. 
The nav bar at the top and the footer (sticky nav bar at the bottom) are set to 12 columns in lg, md, sm, and xs for consistancy and therefore shouldn't change. 
There is a pictures file and additional css style sheet added to the assignment to help with the personalized branding of the webpages, such as the aqua color, serif font, and padding and margin choices.
